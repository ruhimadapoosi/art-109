    <h1>Internet of the Future</h1>
    <p>
        	More and more now, it feels like the internet is becoming unusable. Generative AI is impossible to escape and increasingly harder to differentiate from reality. There are advertisements everywhere, and if you want to escape them you have to subscribe to 50 different platforms. It’s a capitalistic digital world, and yet we stay glued to our screens. It’s where our community lies, it’s where you can get the dopamine rush to avoid reality, and it’s basic life at this point. And all this will only get worse. The future of the internet will be very addictive, integrated, and expensive. 
        <br><br>
            The biggest aspect of the internet is how it connects and informs us all. But that connection and information has reached a point of surveillance. We see it in community spaces online, where it’s hard to keep your life private, people are really good at finding information about where you might work, who you know, what you do, and so on in your life, especially when societal norms encourage you to have that information online. If you want a job, it’s hard to find one without using sites like LinkedIn, if you want to keep in touch with people, it’s hard to do that without using platforms like Instagram. There are a lot of benefits to these platforms, it truly does connect people, but it also makes personal information way more accessible to anyone only. Not only that, but whenever we open a site, it uses cookies and often collects information on us to share with marketers. Ad tracking is everywhere, and it’s practically impossible to use the web without information being collected. We have a huge surveillance culture online, and I think it will only be far more normalized into everyday life in the future. 
        <br><br>
            We can already see the effects of information collection online. Everyone has very curated algorithms that feed them content that keeps them scrolling and addicted to these online platforms. Advertising is way more targeted as well, because this information allows them to figure out what demographics users may fall into because of their online presence. There really isn't true anonymity online anymore. Advertising is more niche, but also it’s increased by a lot compared to early internet. The amount of advertisements you see on every site is so much more- early youtube did not play ads at the frequency you do nowadays. There are a lot of ads on platforms like instagram and tiktok that you can barely tell are ads, because they’re so integrated into the platforms and replicate how everyday users use social media. Despite how annoying this constant advertising is, users continue to use these platforms- they’re designed to be addictive and have integrated too much into our everyday lives to easily log off of. I think a future internet will be one where these social media platforms have continued to test the limits of how much they survey, how much they can advertise, and how deceptive they can allow marketing to be, because that’s what makes the money. They will push limits, make things feel normalized, and continue to push them again, until we reach a point where we accept this fate- the idea that we will be surveyed, and that it’s ok, big brother is watching and whatnot. 
        <br><br>
            I think this surveillance culture will be intertwined and worsened by the integration of technology into everyday life. We already use our phones for everything- I certainly would not know how to get anywhere without google maps, know the time without my phone, or be able to keep in touch with people without it. Technological products are getting even more integrated- we have smart fridges, and listening technology like siri and alexa, glasses that record people. All this is normalized and I can only imagine what else tech companies will integrate to push boundaries, and make these things get more and more normalized, us more and more reliant on this technology. I could see a world where we have screens of pretty images instead of windows, screens instead of mirrors, and some of these things already exist- there are digital photoframes that scroll through images. But again, these tech companies want information, they want to market you things. I think these integrated items will only further be used to record and take information and force unwanted advertisements, to the point where it’s normal to look in the mirror and see advertisements for skincare products. There will barely be a separation of online and real life in the future. 
        <br><br>
            If it’s money these platforms are after, then they can get it- through subscription fees, no need to subject yourself to constant advertising. Except, we’re gonna see those fees get more and more expensive. Places like Hulu have subscription tiers where you get access to their catalog of media, but you still get served advertisements- and you have to pay a higher price if you want the tier where they don’t bombard you with ads. And almost everything is paywalled nowadays- if you want to read a simple newspaper article you need to subscribe, and they track if you’ve used up the “one free article.” More and more sites will be paywalled in order to have any usability, and the paywalling will only get more expensive. And it will be harder to avoid the paywalling as technology gets more integrated into daily life, keeping people reliant and addicted to being online. It also doesn’t help with how unusable online surfing is with the explosion of generative ai. It’s harder and harder to tell what’s real and what’s fake online, and there already was a concern of misinformation prior to all this, but now it’s horrendous. This means that not only is the internet harder to use on a basic level, but the few platforms that we consider “trusted” will be far more essential for media literacy and understanding “truth” and “reality.” If these platforms have more value and are more relied on, it makes it harder to separate from them and more likely for people to pay whatever necessary subscription fees these platforms have- because there are fewer and fewer resources with the same level of credibility.  These “trusted sources” will have a monopoly on credible information. I could even see worsening censorship, because if there are less trusted sources, and these sources are very capitalized, the people at the top have more power and incentive to control narratives online. I could see more censorship within these fewer “credible platforms.”
        <br><br>
            I think all this will happen, but I also think the world cycles, and people will continue to resist. With a larger tech monopoly and more unusable basic internet, I think we will see (and are already seeing) resistance in the form of returning to simplicity. People are trying to decenter technology and participating in “real life” is a form of digital resistance. I could see smaller groups of people retreating to smaller platforms, a return of the “old internet” where most things have their own niche independent platform. But I could see many of these platforms cycling back to that monetization aspect- subscription models for a service people come to rely on. The internet is sooo big and will only get bigger- everyone has a unique algorithm and curation of their digital worlds, and I could see that get increasingly more individualized. Both in the creation of more and more smaller digital communities, but also in regard to how much information will get tracked and served to people. Nonetheless, the internet will become more integrated into daily life, with us being more reliant and addicted to it all because of online information gathering, and with that information, people will use it to profit and a usable internet will be increasingly paywalled.
